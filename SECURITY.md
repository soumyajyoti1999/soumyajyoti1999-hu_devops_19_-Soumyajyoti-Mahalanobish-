The concerned secret.txt file contains information of our credentials. So, as asked we were supposed to include it in the local respository and we were 
supposed to also push it to the remote repository i.e. GitHub. So using a .gitignore file I acheived that function. gitignore as mentioned in the git 
documentation doesn't track the changes or the modifications made to the files that are mentioned within them.
