Git Assigment
After having a wonderful session on Git and Docker, we were assigned an assignment on both. This is the once on Git and Github.
The process I followed till Q7 are as follows:
1. Firstly, I created my remote repository on Github, with an intention to clone it to my local system and then work on it.
2. Configuring password less authentication could be achieved by Personal Access tokens which generated a key and that key 
   I used during the git clone command to clone or download the remote repository on Github.
3. I could make a branch naming git-assignment using git chekcout-b git-assignment which solves our Q4.
4. Now using the concept of gitignore files which served the purpose of intentionally ignore the files/ the file extensions 
   mentioned within it to be tracked to the staging area. i.e. any file name mentioned within gitignore will not be shown on remote repositiory.
5. security.md file was made as per the questionarre where I described that how secret.txt was being encrypted rather not tracked because it contained 
   important credentials.
6. The &th question asked to make a readme.md file which is being done as I am typing this document.
